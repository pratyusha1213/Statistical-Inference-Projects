# DS.v3.2.1.5
# Mental Health in the Tech Industry Analysis

## Overview

This notebook analyzes mental health trends within the tech industry using survey data. The primary goals are to explore the prevalence of mental health conditions, identify demographic factors related to mental health, and provide actionable insights for improving mental health support in tech workplaces.

## Objectives

- **Demographic Analysis**: Examine age, gender, nationality, and other demographics.
- **Mental Health Prevalence**: Determine the rate of specific mental health conditions.
- **Workplace Factors**: Assess the impact of workplace culture and support on mental health.
- **Recommendations**: Suggest improvements for data collection and mental health programs.

## Requirements

The notebook uses the following Python libraries:
- **Data Handling**: `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Database Connection**: `sqlite3`
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Statistical Analysis**: `scipy.stats`

To install these packages, use:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

## Contents

1. **Data Import**: Connects to the SQLite database containing mental health data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes demographics and mental health trends.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates prevalence rates and confidence intervals for mental health conditions.
4. **Conclusions and Further Improvements**: Summarizes key insights and suggests future research directions.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Ensure the SQLite database file (`mental_health.sqlite`) is in the same directory.
3. Open and run the notebook in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.

To disable the **Anaconda Assistant** (if installed by default) and avoid cell-numbering issues, use:
```bash
jupyter labextension disable @anaconda/assistant
```

## Further Improvements

Future iterations of this analysis can benefit from:
- Additional data on job roles, working hours, and workplace support systems.
- Advanced statistical modeling to predict mental health risk factors.
- Regional comparisons to support location-specific programs.
